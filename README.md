## 👋 Looking to collaborate on videos.
I love programming and wish I had known about this world sooner.

I had no idea how fun much it is and how welcoming and friendly this industry is. Thanks to the people who shared their knowledge and experience, I found my passion.

**I'm trying to pay it forward, and I'd be happy to have you join me!** Share your expertise or story with me and my audience. Let's make programming more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.


DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/janechao_dev) if you're interested in collaborating or have any ideas you'd like to create together.  😊
